# How to download or play online McDonald’s game in 2023? [WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX]

The other day I got nostalgic about this game ; a satirical [parody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody) of the business practices of the corporate quick-service restaurant giant [McDonald’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s), taking the guise of a tycoon-style business-simulation game.
